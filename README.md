# Student Loans with Deep Learning  

## Overview  
 This project uses smart computer learning to look at student loans and guess if people can pay them back. It has a bunch of loan info, and the notebook helps clean the data, train the computer, and check how well it learns to find out what makes it easier or harder to repay loans.

## Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and transforms student loan data for machine learning.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifies trends and relationships in student loan repayment.  
- **Deep Learning Model**: Implements a neural network for predictive analysis.  
- **Model Evaluation**: Assesses model performance using accuracy, loss metrics, and validation techniques.  

## Requirements  
Ensure the following dependencies are installed before running the notebook:  

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow keras
```

## How to Use  
1. **Load the dataset** – Ensure the dataset is accessible in the notebook environment.  
2. **Run the notebook cells** – Execute each cell in order for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.  
3. **Analyze the results** – Review accuracy and loss metrics to assess model performance.  
4. **Tune hyperparameters** – Adjust neural network parameters to improve predictions.  

## File Structure  
- `student_loans_with_deep_learning.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing data processing, model training, and evaluation steps.  

## Notes  
- Ensure the dataset is formatted correctly before running the notebook.  
- Modify hyperparameters as needed to optimize model performance.  
- Consider additional feature engineering to improve predictions.
